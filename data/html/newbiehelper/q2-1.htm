!Newbie Guide:

Are you ready for a new mission?

After swapping the Weapon Exchange Ticket you received previously with the Non-Grade Shadow Weapon, go visit <font color="LEVEL">%tonpc%</font> and return after receiving quest reward.
 To find <font color="LEVEL">%tonpc%</font>, follow the <font color="LEVEL">arrow</font> above your head. I will tell you more later.

Can I help you with anything else?
