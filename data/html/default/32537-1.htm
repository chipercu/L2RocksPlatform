<br>As if they're the flames that have been put out, the low moaning sound from falling souls spreads over the other side of the gap.<br>It seems to be a passage to the <font color="LEVEL">Hall of Erosion</font>, where the souls are sucked into Ekimus and part of the Seed of Infinity.<br>(Hall of Erosion is an instant zone exclusively for command channel where minimum 18 and maximum 27 people can enter.)
