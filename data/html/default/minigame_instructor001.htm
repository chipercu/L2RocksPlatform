!Treasure seeker Sumiel:

Success! 
You've found this room, wandered around this Monastery of Silence for a long time, got lost, got hungry, found your way here now, haven't you? 
Trust me when I say I don't know where the treasure is. 
I'd be long gone if I did. 
But I've had time to look, and I think there is a connection in the turning order of this furnace... 
I think we can solve the puzzle if we have an item to light. 
Do you want to give it a try? 
Tricky part is this, we have to light it within a certain time...
