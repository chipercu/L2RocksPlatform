!Reputation Manager Rapidus:

Tell me what you want, and if you are worthy I will help you.

If you have already *bestowed them with a special ability*, *top-grade weapons and armor* can be enhanced *beyond A-Grade* especially for PvP combat.
 Once a multi-user item is specialized, you will still be able to enchant the item.
 However, you *cannot refine, crystallize, convert or add an attribute to it.* Think carefully before making a decision...
