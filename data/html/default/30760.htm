!Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:

How do you do, young one? I am Sir Gustav Athebaldt, loyal knight of the royal bodyguards.

I know what you’re thinking, and while my bones may be creaking from years of fighting, I still have plenty of fight left in me.

See, the future of our nation can not be left to the caprices of lords and kings. The former only seek to satisfy their own self-interests, while kings deny their people’s hardships. The onus then falls on men like me to uphold the values that our nation was built on so many years ago. 

I heard that others openly proclaim their desire for anarchy… of chaos. But rule must be maintained, a system must be established so that others cannot slip in unhindered and sow the seeds of tyranny. As the saying goes, my friend, better the devil you know than devil you don’t.
