	We must be prepared before confronting Freya. 
	As the winter cold swells around the castle, she becomes even stronger. 
	We can use blitz tactics and strike her before her power matures fully. 
	Then again, if we wait until she is at full strength, I'm sure the reward will be greater. 
	I leave the choice to you.<br>
