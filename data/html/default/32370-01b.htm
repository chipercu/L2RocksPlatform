Old Dwarven Ghost:<br>
Thank the gods... Finally someone willing to help me...<br>
I will send you...up the stairs of this tower... That is all I can do for now...<br>
You will encounter powerful devils...who will try your strength...<br>But unintentionally... some of the devils...may be of help to you...<br>
Watch out... and increase your strength...in order to survive in this tower...<br>
