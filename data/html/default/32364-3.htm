!Hellbound Traitor:

Ah! Ambitious, eh? The Steel Citadel values a trait like that.

But lefs think this through. You might get credit from the Steel Citadel for ridding them of that wretched rebel, but what would I get? Don't you think that I deserve some compensation as well?

I need *10 Marks of Betrayal*.

If you bring them, I will open this door for you.
