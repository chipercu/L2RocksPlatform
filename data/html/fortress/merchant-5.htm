If you conquer all of the barracks, weakening 
your oppenents' defensive system, the command 
gate will open. Entering the command post, you 
will find a Flag of Combat on the first floor that 
symbolizes the authority of the fort. You can end 
the battle by hanging it from the flag pole on the 
very highest floor.

Be warned, though, that all of the barracks' 
functions will returm to normal after a short time, 
so you must conquer the fortress withing 10 
minutes.
