!Blacksmith of Mammon:

O you who lords over the Seal of Gnosis, may Mammon's blessing be upon you! I, the Blacksmith of Mammon, have ventured deep underground in order to offer you the highest quality weapons available.

My skill with weapons and armor cannot be matched by inexperienced blacksmiths.

I have one condition, however. We Dwarves of Mammon do not accept money from the outside world. If you wish to trade with us, you must prepare *Ancient Adena*.
