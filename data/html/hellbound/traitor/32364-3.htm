!Hellbound Traitor:

Ah!

Ambitious, eh?

The Steel Citadel values a trait like that.

But lefs think this through.

You might get credit from the Steel Citadel for ridding them of that wretched rebel, but what would I get?

Don't you think that I deserve some compensation as well?

I need *10 Marks of Betrayal*.

If you bring them, I will open this door for you.
