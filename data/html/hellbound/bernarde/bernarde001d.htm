!Bernarde:

He must be from our island - he has a robust complexion that I haven't seen anywhere else!

I have news from those who have visited the Ancient Temple Remnants.

They say that the soul of Derek, the First Generation Seer, wanders that place.

Will you go and investigate the Ancient Temple Remnants?

If you encounter Derek, please help him enter Nirvana.
