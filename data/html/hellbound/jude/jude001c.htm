!Jude:

I hear that the Natives' village is often attacked these days.

I don't know how the Natives gathered all those treasures and hid them, but that's what the Keltas are after.

Do me a favor and bring me that treasure before it's all plundered.

The compensation will be more than adequate, I promise you.

Bring me 40 Native Treasures as fast as you can.
