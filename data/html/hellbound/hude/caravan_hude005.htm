!Hude:

Oh, look who's here!

I've got a big opportunity this time.

If you catch the Chimeras in the Battered Lands with the Magic Bottle, you can obtain a unique item.

Bring me 56 Life Forces and 14 Contained Life Forces.

Then we will accept you as our friend.

Before you go, take a look at the special item that we use. 

[scripts_services.Talks.Hude:getThirdMark|Tell him that you have brought the Life Forces and Contained Life Forces.]

[scripts_services.Talks.Hude:tradeSpecial|Look at the item.]
