!Hude:

Ah, it's you!

I was hoping it was Falk...

I haven't heard from him for over a week.

If you happen to see him, please tell him that I'm looking for him.

I know that he went looking for Scorpion Poison Stingers, which are very useful as medicine...

Say, perhaps you would be wiling to go and get me 60 Scorpion Poison Stingers and 30 Marks of Betrayal?

If you do, I will give you a voucher so you can trade with me.
