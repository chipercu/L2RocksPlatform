!Gatekeeper Tamil:

You've heard of the Ivory Tower? Well, I am one of only a few Orcs ever initiated into the magic of the Gatekeepers Guild? Really, you don't know about the Ivory Tower? How can you not know the center of magic, where all the great Mystics in the world gather to increase their wisdom!

Ah ha, now you're starting to show proper respect. So, are you ready to experience the power of the gate?
