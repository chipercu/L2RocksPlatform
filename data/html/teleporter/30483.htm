!Gatekeeper Mozella:

My name is Mozella. I am one of the researchers dispatched from Oren's Ivory Tower to search for the giants of ere secrets, lost in the Tower of the Giants. Right now, ourresearch team has discovered what we think is a space traveling device of the giants of ere, and we are trying to unlock its secrets. This place was untouched by the outside world so the mysteries of the giants remained undisturbed until our arrival, Unfortunately, the tower is full of frightful monsters.

If you wish to explore the mysterious ruins and brave their dangers, i will open the door of space and time and admit you to the inside of the tower.
