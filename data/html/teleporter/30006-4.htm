!Gatekeeper Roxxy:


The Ivory Tower is the foremost temple of all Mystic's. It has been well known as such ever since the age of Elmoreden. I was born here, and studied at the Ivory Tower after graduating from Einhovant's School of Wizardry. If you happen to go to the Ivory Tower later on, please give my best regards to Grand Sorcerer Valerie. She is my teacher and a wonderful, caring person.%%
