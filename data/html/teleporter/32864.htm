Separated Soul:

The Claw of Antharas barely touched my face, but it gripped my soul, and ripped it from me!

I can sense the other souls around here. If you want, I can send you to where these souls are located.

Also, using the *Will of Antharas* that you have, I can break the *seal on the Blood Crystal*. How about it?
