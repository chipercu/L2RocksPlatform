Smelting allows you to infuse different energy to weapons or accessories. Of course, Soul Crystals can also grant special abilities. But this is a simpler way. It may not be as reliable, however...

A few days ago, an ore called the *Stone of Life*, which has very similar characteristics to Soul Crystals, was discovered. If you bring me the Stone of Life, the weapons you wish altered and a few other necessary items, I will smelt them.

Just remember that *we don't know what kind of powers will be imbued after it smelting* because the Stone of Life has not been completely analyzed. Moreover, *only the owner of the accessories and weapons may use them once they are smelted* since the Stone of Life is greatly influenced by its owner. In addition, *any accessory or weapon that exceeds the owner's skill will not display the effect of smelting*

Hmm... I should tell you that although it is expensive, it is possible to restore weapons after they have been smelted with the Stone of Life.

Ah, one last thing. Smelting accessories requires accurate hand processing and excellent materials. As a result, it costs a little more and requires a higher grade Stone of Life. Please consider that carefully.

Now then, what do you think? Do you want to smelt it?
