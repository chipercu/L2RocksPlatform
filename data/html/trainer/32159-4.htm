You want to remove the Stone of Life? Fine, fine. After all, augmenting makes things better -- but it can come with certain penalties.

Be aware that it won't be easy to transform this back to the original weapon simply by removing the Stone of Life. I have to treat it with a special chemical and use some very special tools. I'm not worried about making a mistake, you understand, but I will have to be compensated for my time...

So, would you still like to remove the Stone of Life from the augmented weapon?
