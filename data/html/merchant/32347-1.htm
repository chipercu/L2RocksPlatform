!Shadai:

The Ancient Text of the Demon is an old tome regarded as an unholy scripture by the Demons of Hellbound.

It was created throught the power of darkness and contains a mysterious energy, which can be very useful - if you can obtain it, of course.

If you bring it to me, i can put it to good use - it will be utterly useless to you, in case you had other ideas.

But give it to me and I will exchange it for an item of greater value for you.
