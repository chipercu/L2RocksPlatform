!Feed Seller:

Welcome! Ferocious animals are raised here! If you're lucky, you'll find that your animals obey you. If not... You'd be better off killing them before they kill you.

I sell two types of feed for fierce animals: *Gold Spice* and *Crystal Spice*.

The Gold Spice makes them fleshy while the Crystal Spice strengthens their bones and skin. Feed your animal the Gold Spice if you want it to look well-cared-for. Feed it the Crystal Spice if you want it to grow strong and powerful.

If you're not sure which one to use, try both and compare. You'll spot the differences immediately.
