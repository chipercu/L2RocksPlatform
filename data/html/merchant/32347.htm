!Shadai:

Greetings, traveler!

I am Shadai of Hellbound.

The legendary Dwarven blacksmith.

Ah, I know I may look a bit shabby, but you mustn't judge a sword by its sheath!

Ha ha ha!

You are a lucky fellow, my friend, to have bumper into me.

Interested in turning that luck into wealth?

I'll make your a deal: if you get me an item I need, I'll use my skills to craft you something.
