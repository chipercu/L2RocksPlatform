!Beast Herder Tunatun:

Rarely, a baby beast appears that doesn't have a trace of evil in its heart. These beasts make very loyal and affectionate pets. No more than one in twenty are so well-disposed... When the beast nears maturity, it produces a white gemstone known as a *Jewel of Innocence*. It's proof that the beast was raised properly. The gemstone is a reward for the master, for the patience and hard work invested.
