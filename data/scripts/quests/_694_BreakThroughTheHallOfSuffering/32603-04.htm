Each room has a <font color="LEVEL">Tumor of Death</font> guarded by various monsters.<br>You must <font color="LEVEL">deactivate</font> this Tumor. Once you have done so, it will become a <font color="LEVEL">Destroyed Tumor</font>.<br>Of course, the monsters will try to stop you. Once the Tumors in all 5 rooms are deactivated, you may proceed.<br>But I leave it up to you whether to face the monsters or the Tumors first. Remember, even if you destroy the Tumor, the nearby monsters won't simply disappear.<br><a action="bypass -h Quest _694_BreakThroughTheHallOfSuffering 32603-04a.htm">Keep listening.</a></body></html>
