!Jude:

Ah!

By my count, you have collected less than *200 *Evil Weapons.

You can obtain more from the *Lesser Evils and Greater Evils in the Monster Foundry*.

Do your best!

If you collect *200 Evil Weapons*, I will exchange them for the S80 Grade weapon recipe.

If you prefer, I can also exchange 5 Evil Weapons for 3 S80 Grade weapon pieces right now.
