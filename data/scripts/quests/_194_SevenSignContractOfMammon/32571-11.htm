!Secret Agent Collin:

So you've conned a talking frog and old lady, now comes the real test. I want you to speak to one of the adult vilagers here and get him to hand you one of their belongings.

Do it and we'll be done with our training'. Fail and we'll know more work is needed. Ready for the transformation.

[Quest _194_SevenSignContractOfMammon 32571-12.htm|"I think so."]

(The transformation will cancel all movement-related buffs, including the PC room buffs, other than energy buffs).
