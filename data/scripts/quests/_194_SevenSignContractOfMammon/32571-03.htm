!Secret Agent Collin:

Yes, magically transformed. You'll be visually undistinguishable from the priests. But as any spy worth his salt knows, there's more to a disguise than getting dressed into fancy rags. Gotta play the part too, move like them, talk like them, think like them.

Right, eniugh chat. Your first task will be to see the *Frog King* at the nearby lake and windle him out of there before they have your legs for lunch.

(The transformation will cancel all movement and speed related buffs).
