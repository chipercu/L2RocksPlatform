!Sir Gustav Athebaldt:

We do--the *Priests of Dawn* hold the page. One of our spies was able to find the document, but was discovered and killed before we could spirit him away.

I want you to go in his place, infiltrate the Priests of Dawn and steal the *last page of that contract.* We'll train you up first, or rather *Agent Collin* will.

You'll find him at *Oren's South Entrance*. Take him this note else he'll tell you little more than the time of day.
