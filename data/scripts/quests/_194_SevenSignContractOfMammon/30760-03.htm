!Sir Gustav Athebaldt:

As most do.

But many are not aware of a great battle that bubble under the surface, between our order and the Order of Dusk. We fight for control over the Seven Seals, the seals Shunaiman himself created to fight Shilen and her armies.

These seals are burried deep in Aden's catacombs and necropolises, areas which have turned into helish battlefiels.
