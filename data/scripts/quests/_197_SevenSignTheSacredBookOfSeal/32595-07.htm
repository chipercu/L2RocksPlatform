!Great Master Lawrence:

Let me read the prayer quietly..

*The Emperor's Key!! Hmm... Back then the emperor of Elmore-Aden started the holy war. A winged messenger of Einhasad appeared, turning the tides of battle...*

*The 6 catacombs became graves to followers of darkness.. The 7 Necropolis turned to battlefields for the army of death... This is how the divine Einhasad tells the tale.*

Hm.

Right.. Now I've got it. It couldn't be simpler. Ha haha!
