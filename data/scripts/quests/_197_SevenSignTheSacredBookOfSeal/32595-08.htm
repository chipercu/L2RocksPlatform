!Great Teacher Lawrence:

Sigh... don't you see? "These are the records.." Now, where are records kept? The library! Start with the *Library of Sages In Rune*--they have the oldest records collection In the kingdom.

I believe *Sophia* Is still the director there, and she has one of the most gifted minds In ail of Aden.

Give her the number, and mention my name-I'm sure she'll give you all me help she can. But hurry... I fear the worst Is yet to come.
