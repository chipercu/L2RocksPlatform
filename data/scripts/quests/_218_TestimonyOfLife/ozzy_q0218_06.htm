!Hierarch Asterios:

Long ago the first guardian sacrificed herself to give life to the Mother Tree. There are so many fewer Elves now that we cannot afford to lose one if we wanted to, and believe me, we don't! I hope that I never see anything so horrible again in my life!

Fortunately, we have another way to restore health to the Mother Tree. We must obtain the *Water of Life* mentioned in the Giants' creation story... The sacred water flowed from the fountain of Eva and gave birth to the first living things in the beginning of times...

The Water of Life has flowed through all rivers and streams since, and given life to the earth. But with the great flood it became diluted and contaminated.

For thousands of years we thought that the Water of Life was lost to us...

We didn't dare imagine, but now we know that it can still be found, in the tears of the purest being. You must meditate on what I have told you.
