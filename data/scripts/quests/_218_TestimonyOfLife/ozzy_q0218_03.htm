!Hierarch Asterios:

Humans can be quite charming and even brave at times, but their ignorance and greed always seem to triumph in the end. They can always be counted on invent a new future, but we Elves must constantly guard against that future being at our expense...

The reason I have called you together is of utmost urgency. Our mother, the Mother Tree, is ailing and will surely die without assistance. This is of mortal concern to all Elves. Are you ready to dedicate yourself to saving our Mother Tree?
