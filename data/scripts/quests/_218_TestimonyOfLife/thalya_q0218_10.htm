!Thalia:

At this moment, Talin's Spear is being transported here from Innadril. We must wait until it arrives.

You seem to lack the adequate experience to use the power of the spear fully. How about going for a journey of discipline while we have the time? *When you feel that you are ready, come back and see me.* Perhaps Talin's Spear will have arrived by then.
