!Master Cardien:

You have returned! Your eyes tell the tale -- you have learned much in such a short time. I perceive that you have experienced a deep sorrow, but I see you have also grown in wisdom.

This is the Camomile Charm that Hierarch gave you to fight for the tribe's survival. But I think you are ready for more advanced teaching now.

Here is the *Mark of Life*. Keep it with you -- it will assist you wherever your path leads you in the future. No matter what trials you must face, never forget the sacred time you spent in the shadow of Mother Tree, learning our timeless lessons of balance and beauty. May Eva's peace be with you always!
