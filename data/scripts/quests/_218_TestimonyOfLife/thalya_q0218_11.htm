!Thalia:

There is terrible news! *Talin's Spear has been stolen!* The lake spirits who were bringing it from Innadril were attacked by lizardmen who massacred them and absconded with the spear.

You must hurry and meet *Isael Silvershadow of the Hunter's Village*. He will need assistance finding the spear. We must find Talin's Spear! Our future lies within it!
