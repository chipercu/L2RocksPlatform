!Priest Adonius:

Brother, have you come to learn the secrets of *Andariel's Book*? Have you come to contemplate the goodness of Einhasad related in the sacred texts? May the Goddess accompany you on your journey to the truth...

Dark forces are gathering, wanting to destroy this precious book, the keeper of the tenet of light. It must be protected at all costs, I cannot allow it to leave this sanctuary. However I regret not being able to fulfill the request of a brother....

Perhaps something can be done. As we speak, scores of Priests are transcibing these holy scriptures onto lambskin. We hope that by creating many copies of the texts the truth of Einhasad will spread around the world. Copies will be sent to the guardians of the Mother Tree and Einhasad shrines around the world.

Would you care to help us?
