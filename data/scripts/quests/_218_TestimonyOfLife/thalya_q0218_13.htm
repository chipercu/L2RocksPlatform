!Thalia:

I have terrible news! *Talin's Spear has been stolen on its way here!* It is said that the lake spirits who were bringing the sword from Innadril were attacked by the lizardmen who massacred them and absconded with the spear.

You must hurry to *Isael Silvershadow of the Hunter's Village*. Help him deal with this matter. We must find  Talin's Spear! Our future lies within it!
