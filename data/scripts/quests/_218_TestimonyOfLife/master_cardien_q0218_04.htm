!Master Cardien:

When you have completed this task and return, I shall present you with the *Mark of Life*.

Now more than ever we must take the love of nature into our hearts and meditate upon our place in the family of creatures. As our first guardian sacrificed herself, we must sacrifice to overcome this difficulty.

Hierarch Asterios has called the young Elves to gather in the Elven Forest. Your trial has begun. *Now you must take this letter to the hierarch in your hometown.* May the blessings of starlight guide your way.
