!Expedition Leader Sobling:

It is now possible to explore the upper level of the Giant's Cave thanks to the help of many adventurers. Because of that, now we can finally undertake a more rigorous expedition.

It will be more dangerous than past forays into the Giant's Cave, but I hope you will help us nevertheless.
