!High Priest Raymond:

There we go! Now you'll need to use the *Light of Dawn teleporter* here in the *Temple* to get to the Sanctum. Once there use your *invisibility skills, move fast*, and *steer clear from the guards*.

Oh, and the code! 72.79.78.71. 72.79.78.71, 72.79.78.71. DO NOT forget it!

*(See High Priest Raymond again to clear the Sentry Morph after abandoning the quest.)*
