!Collector Yumi:
What brings you to this dangerous place? Ah, you have come here because of the Starstones, haven't you?
 Beware! It is exceedingly difficult to collect the Starstones because of the golems.

(Only characters who have cleared the Pavel the Giant Quest at level 70 or above may accept this quest.)
