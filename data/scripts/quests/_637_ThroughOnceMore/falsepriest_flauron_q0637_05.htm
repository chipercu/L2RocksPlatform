!Priest Flauron:

You already have the Mark of the Pagan, so you don't need to hear this story again.

Oh, by the way, a little remind for you: Although you realized your own frailty and brought your combined might can do anything to stop us. Lord Triol was quite aware of the danger a party of adventurers might present, so he *cast a spell that will scatter an invading party to the winds.* So don't waste your time fighting us - you'll never prevail.

(If a party of six or more fight inside the Pagan Temple, there is a chance that some fo the party members will be teleportred elsewhere.)
