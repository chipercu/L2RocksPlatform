!Lighthouse Keeper Rockswell:

You still don't have enough keltir fur. If you collect *ten pelts of keltir fur* and go see *Cristel,* she will make them into yarn for you. You can meet Cristel at the well in front of the village warehouse. Then, take the yarn she gives you and go find Rolfe. You can meet Rolfe at the warehouse.
