!Balu Kaimu:

Long long ago, when dinosaurs had finished their migration to the Lost Nest under 
the supervision of the Elkrokhian warriors, Elkrokhian civilization was at its peak.

The seal stones set in place by my mother Shilen and the statues that reflected her beauty were arranged in perfect harmony. 
The island was ferile and peaceful.

Shilen even enlistened the help of the other gods to make this place a true paradise. 
Dinosaurs and Elrokhians coexisted in peace and prosperity in those days.
