!Chuta Kaimu:

Both the wisdom I possess and that of my brother Balu Kaimu confirm that you are whom you say you are. 
It was fated that we should meet.

Outsider od fate, what wisdom do you seek from me? 
To repay you  for awakening me from ages of silent slumber, ask me anything you wish to know.
