!Emperor Shunaiman:

Don't worry about me! I am built of simple flesh and bone, but the Empire... it houses the dreams of so, so many people.

Now, listen. The final room contains *four sealing devices*, each of which need to be activated. You will then need to gather the *four Binding Seals*... and bring them back to me.

Do not lose *the sword*, and do not discard the *holy water*--they are absolutely vital to our survival!
