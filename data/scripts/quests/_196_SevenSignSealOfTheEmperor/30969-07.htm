Incredible... so the seal was under threat many years ago, and we must now go and *aid the Emperor* by travelling back to the time of his rule?

The science is mind-boggling, frankly. How will we know what implications your interference will cause? But then... what if the past IS our past BECAUSE you time-travelled. Oh....

There's no time to ponder any of this--just *go to the Disciple's Necropolis* and *find the Promise of Mammon*! I'll send word If I discover something's amiss!
