!Detention Camp Warden:

Of course you can patisipate. But before you do, there are several things you should know. There are 4 researchers currently inspecting the Rim Pailaka that can be enetered from Rune Fortress.

Because of the mystical dream-nature of Rim Pailaka, we don't know what will happen to them if they "die" in there. Our goal therefore, is to bring them all home safely. *People say attacks in that strange place develop over 3 stages. Defend them from each!*

One more thing. It would be unwise to eneter Rim Pailaka alone. Find another clan member willing to accompany you. Then I'll send you in.

There's no time to waste. Please hurry!
