!Warehouse Chief Natools:

The Temple and the Lords of Dawn believe that Einhasad created Humans, and they see themselves as righteous because they are her followers.

They believe that the other gods and their followers are inferior and should unite under their command to battle the forces of Shilen...

They value order and justice above all, and feel that diversity leads to dissention, which will undermine the war effort.

In their eyes, only a strictly ordered society can ensure peace and the protection of the weak.

They have a point -- the weak are certainly not protected in this chaotic world, nor is there unity in facing the coming darkness.

Their ultimate goal is to re-establish a strong empire like the old days under Emperor Shunaiman...
