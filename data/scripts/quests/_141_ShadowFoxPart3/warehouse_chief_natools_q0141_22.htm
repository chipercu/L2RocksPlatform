!Warehouse Chief Natools:

They argue that we should respect diversity....

They believe that all power and all living things are equal on this earth, and that the Temple and the Lords should use their power to protect the powerless.

Instead, they say, the Temple and the Lords  simply exploit the people to protect their own interests and vested rights.

They are hypocrites...

The Revolutionaries of Dusk believe that true peace is not artificially imposed on society by a central authority, but rather achieved through a harmonious diversity of powers and races.

They say that Einhasad did not, in fact, create Humans -- that was a myth fabricated by Shunaiman, and the Temple and Lords of Dawn know the truth but are afraid to reveal it...

The Revolutionaries of Dusk are dedicated to finding some crucial piece of evidence that would permanently discredit their foes.
